# MVC Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Weather Dashboard application has been comprehensively refactored to implement a clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with clear separation of concerns, reduced coupling, and increased cohesion. This document outlines the new architectural structure and design principles.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**

- **Controllers**: Handle business logic coordination and user input processing
- **Views**: Manage presentation layer and user interface abstraction
- **Models**: Define data structures and business entities
- **Business Services**: Encapsulate domain-specific business logic

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**

- Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Dependencies flow in one direction (Controller → View, Controller → Business Services)
- UI logic is separated from business logic

### 3. **Protocol-Based Design**

- All major interfaces are defined using Python Protocols
- Enables dependency inversion and loose coupling
- Facilitates testing and mocking

### 4. **Observer Pattern**

- Controllers notify views of data changes through observers
- Decouples data updates from UI updates
- Supports multiple views listening to the same controller

## Component Details

### Controllers

#### **ApplicationController**

- **Responsibility**: Main application coordination and orchestration
- **Key Features**:
  - Coordinates between weather controller and business services
  - Handles application-level events (theme changes, settings)
  - Manages application lifecycle
  - Implements observer pattern for status updates

#### **WeatherController**

- **Responsibility**: Weather data management and coordination
- **Key Features**:
  - Manages weather data loading and caching
  - Coordinates between weather service and API
  - Implements observer pattern for data updates
  - Handles error states and loading states

### Views

#### **MainView**

- **Responsibility**: Main application view abstraction
- **Key Features**:
  - Wraps legacy UI components
  - Provides clean interface to controllers
  - Handles application-level UI events
  - Implements view protocol contracts

#### **WeatherView**

- **Responsibility**: Weather-specific view abstraction
- **Key Features**:
  - Abstracts weather display logic
  - Handles weather data presentation
  - Provides callback registration for user actions
  - Implements observer interface for data updates

### Business Services

#### **WeatherService**

- **Responsibility**: Weather domain business logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Encapsulates weather data processing
  - Implements caching and validation
  - Provides clean interface to weather operations
  - Handles business rules and data transformations

#### **NotificationService**

- **Responsibility**: Application notification management
- **Key Features**:
  - Centralized notification handling
  - Supports multiple notification types (success, error, info, warning)
  - Implements observer pattern for notification delivery
  - Provides async notification support

#### **SettingsService**

- **Responsibility**: Application settings management
- **Key Features**:
  - Centralized settings management
  - Implements validation and change tracking
  - Provides observer pattern for settings changes
  - Handles settings persistence

### Interfaces (Protocols)

#### **Controller Protocols**

- Define contracts for all controllers
- Ensure consistent interface design
- Enable dependency inversion

#### **View Protocols**

- Define contracts for view components
- Standardize view update methods
- Support multiple view implementations

#### **Service Protocols**

- Define contracts for business services
- Enable service mocking and testing
- Support service composition

## Data Flow

### 1. **User Action Flow**

```text
User Input → View → Controller → Business Service → Model → Storage/API
```

### 2. **Data Update Flow**

```text
API/Storage → Model → Business Service → Controller → Observer → View → UI Update
```

### 3. **Error Handling Flow**

```text
Error Source → Business Service → Controller → Observer → View → User Notification
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Observer Pattern**

- Controllers notify views of data changes
- Business services notify controllers of state changes
- Enables loose coupling between components

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**

- Different notification strategies
- Multiple view implementations
- Configurable business logic

### 3. **Facade Pattern**

- Views provide simplified interface to complex UI components
- Controllers provide simplified interface to business operations

### 4. **Dependency Injection**

- Services injected into controllers
- Views injected into application
- Enables testing and flexibility

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Easy to locate and modify functionality

### 2. **Testability**

- Protocol-based interfaces enable mocking
- Business logic separated from UI
- Clear dependency injection points

### 3. **Extensibility**

- Easy to add new views or controllers
- Business services can be composed
- Observer pattern supports multiple listeners

### 4. **Flexibility**

- UI components can be swapped without affecting business logic
- Business services can be replaced independently
- Configuration-driven behavior

## Migration from Legacy Architecture

### What Was Removed

- `src/core/weather_core.py` - Legacy business logic
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Old architecture documentation
- `launcher.py` - Legacy launcher
- `src/main_mvc.py` - Duplicate entry point

### What Was Added

- Complete MVC structure with controllers, views, and business services
- Protocol-based interfaces for all major components
- Observer pattern implementation
- Enhanced launcher with environment checks
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### What Was Refactored

- `src/main.py` - Now implements MVC coordination
- Legacy UI components wrapped by view abstractions
- Configuration management enhanced
- Logging and error handling improved

## Best Practices

### 1. **Controller Design**

- Keep controllers thin - delegate to business services
- Use observer pattern for view updates
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate input before processing

### 2. **View Design**

- Abstract UI implementations behind protocols
- Handle only presentation logic
- Register for controller updates
- Provide clean callback interfaces

### 3. **Business Service Design**

- Encapsulate domain logic
- Implement validation and caching
- Use protocols for external dependencies
- Handle errors and edge cases

### 4. **Testing Strategy**

- Mock protocols for unit testing
- Test controllers independently of views
- Test business services independently of controllers
- Use integration tests for end-to-end scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Additional Controllers**

- User preferences controller
- Data export controller
- Plugin management controller

### 2. **Enhanced Business Services**

- Weather forecast service
- Data analytics service
- User preference service

### 3. **Alternative Views**

- Web-based view
- Command-line view
- Mobile view

### 4. **Advanced Features**

- Real-time data streaming
- Plugin architecture
- Multi-language support
- Advanced caching strategies

This MVC architecture provides a solid foundation for maintainable, testable, and extensible weather dashboard application development.
