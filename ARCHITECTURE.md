# Separation of Concerns Architecture

## Overview

The weather dashboard has been refactored to implement clean separation of concerns between GUI code and business logic. This architectural improvement makes the code more maintainable, testable, and follows professional software development practices.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Business Logic Layer (`src/core/`)

- **`weather_core.py`** - Core business logic coordinator
- Manages application state and data flow
- Coordinates between services and provides callbacks
- No GUI dependencies or UI code

### 2. Service Layer (`src/services/`)

- **`weather_api.py`** - External API integrations
- Handles all HTTP requests and data fetching
- Provides clean interface to business logic
- No UI dependencies

### 3. Data Layer (`src/models/`)

- **`weather_models.py`** - Data models and type definitions
- Defines data structures for weather, forecast, and air quality
- Type safety throughout the application
- No UI or business logic dependencies

### 4. Configuration Layer (`src/config/`)

- **`app_config.py`** - Application configuration management
- Settings, API keys, and application constants
- Environment variable handling
- No UI dependencies

### 5. User Interface Layer (`src/ui/`)

- **`dashboard_ui.py`** - Main UI components and layout
- **`weather_displays.py`** - Specialized display components
- Pure UI code with no business logic
- Uses callbacks to communicate with business layer

### 6. Application Coordinator (`src/main.py`)

- **`main.py`** - Application coordinator and entry point
- Sets up callbacks between UI and business logic
- Minimal coordination code only
- Clean separation between layers

## Key Improvements

### Before Refactoring

- Mixed GUI code with business logic in single file
- Direct manipulation of UI from business logic
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to test and maintain

### After Refactoring

- **Clean Separation**: UI and business logic are completely separate
- **Callback Pattern**: UI communicates with business logic via callbacks
- **Modular Design**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations throughout
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently

## Component Responsibilities

### WeatherDashboardUI (`dashboard_ui.py`)

```python
class WeatherDashboardUI:
    """Responsible for:
    - Main window layout and controls
    - User input handling (search, theme selection)
    - Status bar and dialogs
    - Callback registration for user events
    """
```

### WeatherDisplays (`weather_displays.py`)

```python
class WeatherDisplays:
    """Responsible for:
    - Current weather display formatting
    - Forecast chart rendering
    - Air quality visualization
    - All weather-related UI components
    """
```

### WeatherDashboardCore (`weather_core.py`)

```python
class WeatherDashboardCore:
    """Responsible for:
    - Business logic coordination
    - Data management and state
    - Service orchestration
    - Callback-based UI communication
    """
```

### WeatherDashboardApp (`main.py`)

```python
class WeatherDashboardApp:
    """Responsible for:
    - Application startup and coordination
    - Connecting UI to business logic
    - Callback setup and management
    - Clean application entry point
    """
```

## Communication Flow

### User Input Flow

1. **User Action** → UI Component (`dashboard_ui.py`)
2. **UI Event** → Callback (`main.py`)
3. **Coordination** → Business Logic (`weather_core.py`)
4. **Data Processing** → Services (`weather_api.py`)
5. **Results** → Callback (`main.py`)
6. **UI Update** → Display Components (`weather_displays.py`)
